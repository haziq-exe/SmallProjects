# SmallProjects

A collection of small, self-contained projects created to explore and understand core concepts from different fields.

## Projects

### MLP_From_Scratch
Implements a multilayer perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy. Includes manual backpropagation with full calculus derivation and step-by-step construction of the training loop.

### MovieRecommendation
Uses embedded vectors for movie features and implements a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch (NumPy-only) to generate movie recommendations based on similarity.

### SlowedNReverbify
Takes an input audio file and applies slow + reverb effects to produce an altered audio output.
